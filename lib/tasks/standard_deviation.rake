  # VARIANCE
  # ========
  # To find the variance of a set,
  #  - we find the mean of the set
  #  - for each number in the set,
  #    - we find the difference between the number and the mean
  #    - we square the difference
  #  - the variance is the mean of the squared differences

  # STANDARD DEVIATION
  # ==================
  # To find the standard deviation of a set,
  #  - take the square root of the variance
